## Security for Data in (REST,Motion,Use)
### Data at Rest
- Transparent data encryption (TDE)
- TDE performs encryption and decryption of the data at the page level.
- Encrypted as the data is written to the data page on disk and decrypted when the data page is read into memory.
- The end result is all data pages on the disk are encrypted.
- Backups are also encrypted because a backup operation copies the data pages from the database file to backup device
- TDE encrypts the storage of an entire database by using a __symmetric key__ called the __Database Encryption Key (DEK)__.
- __Service-managed TDE:__ The DEK is protected by a built-in server certificate.
- __Customer-managed TDE:__ The TDE Protector that encrypts the DEK is supplied by the customer. The TDE Protector is stored in a key management system owned and managed by the customer.
### Data at Motion
- Secure Socket Layers and Transport Layer Security (SSL/TLS)

| Scenario                                                                                      | Possible security solution |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------| -------------------------- |
| Secure access from multiple workstations located on-premises to an Azure virtual network      | Use site-to-site VPN       |
| Secure access from an individual workstation located on-premises to an Azure virtual network  | Use point-to-site VPN      |
| Move large data sets over a dedicated high-speed wide-area network (WAN) link                 | Use Azure ExpressRoute     |
| Interact with Azure Storage through the Azure portal                                          |All transactions are done by using HTTPS. You can also use the Azure Storage REST API over HTTPS to interact with Azure Storage and Azure SQL Database.     |

### Data in Use
- Dynamic Data masking
- Automatically discovers potentially sensitive data in Azure SQL Database and Azure SQL Managed Instance. The feature provides actionable recommendations to mask these fields.
- Dynamic data masking works by obfuscating the sensitive data in the result set of a query.
- The data masking policy can be configured in the Azure portal for Azure SQL Database.
- Dynamic data masking can be set up by using PowerShell cmdlets and the Azure REST API.
